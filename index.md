We’re a group of people who came together with the goal of creating a startup scene that’s more connected, inclusive and wise.

In our Slack Community you can find a curated feed of events, news, job listings and startup content updated every day by people who work on them. 

If you want to get to know or keep up to date with the ever growing startup scene or get settled in Portugal, 351 might be a good first door for you! Our arms are open and every member is reachable without a middle person.

To join our community you have to be invited because we want to make sure 351 remains a safe space for everyone involved. If you’re someone who believes in building long-term relationships instead of handing out business cards, 351 is for you. [**Ask for your invite here.**](https://airtable.com/shrNr1fPzeGAABbk0)
